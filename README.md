## Project Overview
Our project provides a comprehensive cloud-based donation management system tailored for Natureâ€™s Edge Wildlife and Reptile Rescue. By replacing manual processes with digital solutions, we streamline the tracking of donations, automate the generation of customizable thank-you cards, and manage animal intake and adoption forms efficiently. This all-in-one solution enhances operational efficiency, ensuring that Natureâ€™s Edge can focus more on its mission of wildlife rescue and rehabilitation.

## How we built it
The backend solution for this donation management system is built using:
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL

The frontend solution for this donation management system is built using:
- React
- Bootstrap

The cloud solution for this this donation management system is built using:
- Railway

## Your next steps
1. âœ… Add everyone on your team to your GitHub repo like [this video posted in our Slack channel](https://opportunity-hack.slack.com/archives/C1Q6YHXQU/p1605657678139600)
2. âœ… Create your DevPost project [like this video](https://youtu.be/vCa7QFFthfU?si=bzMQ91d8j3ZkOD03)
3. âœ… Use the [2024 DevPost](https://opportunity-hack-2024-arizona.devpost.com) to submit your project
4. âœ… Your DevPost final submission demo video should be 4 minutes or less
5. âœ… Review the judging criteria on DevPost

## Challenges we ran into
One significant challenge we encountered was the inability to successfully integrate a donation management system with third-party services such as GiveButter and PayPal Donations. The primary reason for this is that most of these services require details that we are currently unable to provide, such as bank account numbers and license IDs. To address this issue, we have temporarily developed a mock-up to illustrate how the donation transaction process would look.

## What should your final Readme look like?
Your readme should be a one-stop-shop for the judges to understand your project. It should include:
- Team name
- Team members
- Slack channel
- Problem statement
- Tech stack
- Link to your DevPost project
- Link to your final demo video
- Any other information you think is important

You'll use this repo as your resume in the future, so make it shine! ðŸŒŸ
